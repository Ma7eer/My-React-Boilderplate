# React-Boilerplate
This is my personal React Boilerplate. I built it to try and understand the
inner-workings of popular boilerplate's like create-react-app. The boilerplate
is inspired by the following these two articles by [Nick Karnik](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-your-own-react-boilerplate-2f8cbbeb9b3f)
and [Seth Alexander](https://sethaalexander.com/how-to-build-your-own-react-boilerplate/).

I've used the article as reference but added some personal touches.

My boilerplate features:

* Webpack 4 (Webpack dev server)
* eslint
* CSS-Loaders & Style-loader
* babel

## Setup

```
npm install
npm start
```

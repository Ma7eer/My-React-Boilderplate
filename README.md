# React-Boilderplate
This is my personnal React Boilderplate. I built it to try and understand the innerworkings of popular boilerplates like create-react-app. The boilerplate is inspired by the following an [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-your-own-react-boilerplate-2f8cbbeb9b3f) by Nick Karnik.

I've used the article as reference but added to it as well.

My boilderplate features: 

* Webpack 4
* eslint
* cache busting 
* CSS-Loaders 
* nodemon 
* Replace Express with webpack dev server (currently building...)
* Even more in the works!

## Setup

```
npm install
npm run build
npm install
```
